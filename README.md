# rendition of poke_viewer_1.0 for browser users

Similar to my previous poke_viewer project this allows anyone interested in pokemon to have a lightweight introduction into the franchise. The viewer allows users to select from a list of 152 pokemon and view their abilitites, types, stats and sprite.
