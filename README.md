## rendition of poke_viewer_1.0 for browser users

Similar to my previous poke_viewer project this allows anyone interested in pokemon to have a lightweight introduction into the franchise. The viewer allows users to select from a list of 152 pokemon and view their abilitites, types, stats and sprite.

## Instructions to install
- Install node js
- Clone this git onto your local machine
- cd into the poke_viewer_js folder
- run 'npm install'
- run 'npm run dev'
- visit 'localhost:5000' in a browser of your choice
